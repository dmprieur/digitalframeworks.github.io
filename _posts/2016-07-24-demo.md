I decided to use CartoDB to make a map of Chicago's bike routes. I thought it was interesting when I mapped the bike route data against the neighborhood data that certain neighborhoods barely had any bike routes. Although I couldn't find socioeconomic or crime data for these neighborhoods in Carto, I thought it was intersting that neighborhoods on the South and West side of Chicago along with the area around O'Hare didn't have bike routes. People in these neighborhoods don't have access to a safe way to bike to work or school or simply to exercise. Whehter it's because these neighborhoods don't get funding for bike routes or they're deemed "too unsafe for bike routes," it seems like this is an injustice to these communities.

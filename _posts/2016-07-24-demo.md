I decided to use CartoDB to make a map of Chicago's bike routes. I thought it was interesting when I mapped them against the neighborhoods that certain neighborhoods barely had any bike routes at all. Although I couldn't find socioeconomic or crime data in Carto, I thought it was intersting that neighborhoods like the South and West side of Chicago along with the area around O'Hare didn't have bike routes. That means people in those communities don't have access to a safe transportation if they have to bike to work or school and they don't have a cheap way to exercise.

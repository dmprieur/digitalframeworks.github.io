For the last data adventure, I wanted to focus on farming as my beat this quarter in Washington has been farming and agriculture. 

Last week I wrote a story about U.S. dairy farms, specifically how many smaller, family-owned farms are being forced to close because of a combination of low milk prices and high production costs. 

Many farms, have such high debt from borrowing on equity per milk cow that they close second, third, in some cases even fifth or sixth generation family owned and runned farms. 

I decided to analyze USDA data on financial indicators on farms released on February 9, 2016. The data charts farm income, expenses, assets, debt and equity from 2011 to 2016. 

Here's the Google Sheets of that orginal data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ALx5Q3zCkOwbUhItm2fGwDxgoDztozVVxq16QffHOaY/edit?usp=sharing. 

Then, I decided to focus on debt and equity. If a farmer has more equity available to them, will they have more debt (in other words will they use it to borrow more money for their farm?) 

I focused on just the debt and equity columns. Here's the data on Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yKe-5cJOKkKgapaz33orvgbfZzm7gUYAEL87jVAl1yM/edit?usp=sharing.

When I charted the data against a linear regression model that had a good prediction value of R squared 0.744 (closer to 1, the higher the accuracies of predications made with the regression model), I noticed that as income decreases for farming families, as it has been over the past decade, unfortunately, their debt also increases. Many dairy farmers I've talked to said this is because as their income decreases, and the cost of farming increase, they are forced to take out loans which puts them further in debt. 

Here's the linear regression on Google Sheets: <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yKe-5cJOKkKgapaz33orvgbfZzm7gUYAEL87jVAl1yM/pubchart?oid=978800834&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

When I calculated the intercept value it was about 423, corresponding to the point when farm debt would be at its highest and farmers would essentially be making an income close to zero a year. In other words, when farm debt gets this high, close to 420 billion dollars, the farmer will most likely have to consider selling their farm as they are no longer making a profit. This is concerning as debt is already at around 370 billion dollars (only 50 billion dollars difference from this intercept value) and farm incomes keep falling. If debt continues to rise, and income continues to fall, many small, family farms will have to sell to larger, corporate owned farms (as many in the dairy industry are already doing). 

To test this hypothesis, I decided to forecast what would happen if income kept falling to about 40 billion dollars. The debt would then increase to 382 billion, getting closer to that 420 billion dollar mark. If income increases to 120 billion, however (in most cases this means getting a higher price for agricultural products and more government assistance), then debt would decrease to 299 billion dollars. As Congress prepares to enter into a new session in September and several farming bills are considered, it might be important to remember that price increases and subsidy programs have never been more crucial than they are now. According to a National Agriculture Census from the USDA in 2015, 88 percent of farms are small, family farms and 58 percent of our food comes directly from these farms. If small, family farms continue to close, what will happen to the industry and what will happen to our food?

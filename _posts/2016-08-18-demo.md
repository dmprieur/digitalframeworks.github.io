For the last data adventure, I wanted to focus on farming as my beat this quarter in Washington has been farming and agriculture. 

Last week I wrote a story about U.S. dairy farms, specifically how many smaller, family-owned farms are being forced to close because of a combination of low milk prices and high production costs. 

Many farms, have such high debt from borrowing on equity per milk cow that they close second, third, in some cases even fifth or sixth generation family owned and runned farms. 

I decided to analyze USDA data on financial indicators on farms released on February 9, 2016. The data charts farm income, expenses, assets, debt and equity from 2011 to 2016. 

Here's the Google Sheet of that orginal data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ALx5Q3zCkOwbUhItm2fGwDxgoDztozVVxq16QffHOaY/edit?usp=sharing. 

Then, I decided to focus on the expenses and debt data deleting all but the total expenses and total debt rows. I then plotted this data on a scatter plot and created a linear regression. 

Here's the data on Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dmkd0lqiHur09lR9vIWZVojPC548E5QSv6gKe0_cHFY/edit?usp=sharing. 

And the chart with the linear regression: <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dmkd0lqiHur09lR9vIWZVojPC548E5QSv6gKe0_cHFY/pubchart?oid=451235623&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

The linear regression seems to show as farm production cost increase, so does the amount of debt a farm goes into (R squared value=0.609). 

I was curious where this value would be optimized, in other words at one production cost would debt be at it's highest (what production cost would make it almost impossible for a family farm to continue taking out loans?)

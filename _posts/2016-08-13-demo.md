I wanted to use the scraper to determine what Detroit's foreclosure situation looked like in 2016, almost a decade after the auto industry, the city's main industry, began to fail. I wanted to use a non-government source, like Zillow that was un-filtered to get a sense of the number of homes being put up for foreclosure on a daily basis in the city. 

I did a search for Detroit homes for sale on Zillow and found sixteen pages of results:

I scraped all sixteen pages for location of the homes (address and zip code), type of sale (for sale by owner, foreclosure, etc.), in import.io. After scraping I generated the following CSV file imported into Google Sheets:

After a scan of the data, I decided to delete the url, address, and house description columns in order to focus on the zip code and type of sale columns in a new Google Sheet:

I renamed the two columns zip code and type of sale, and did a quick filter of the "type of sale" column by "foreclosure." There were thirty three foreclosed homes on Zillow that night (around 11 pm). Then, I sorted the "zip code" column from A->Z. A pattern (at lease for that night's foreclosures) was automatically apparent: most of the foreclosed homes were either in the 48204 or 48227 area codes as illustrated by the scatter plot before. The other zip codes in Detroit didn't have foreclosed homes listed that night. 









Finally I imported this data into Google spreadsheets:

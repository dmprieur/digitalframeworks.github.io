I wanted to use the scraper to determine what Detroit's foreclosure situation looked like in 2016, almost a decade after the auto industry, the city's main industry, began to fail. I wanted to use a non-government source, like Zillow that was un-filtered to get a sense of the number of homes being put up for foreclosure on a daily basis in the city. 

I did a search for Detroit homes for sale on Zillow and found sixteen pages of results:

I scraped all sixteen pages for location of the homes (address and zip code), type of sale (for sale by owner, foreclosure, etc.), in import.io. After scraping I generated the following CSV file imported into Google Sheets:

After a scan of the data, I decided to delete the url, address, and house description columns in order to focus on the zip code and type of sale columns in a new Google Sheet:

I renamed the two columns zip code and type of sale, and did a quick filter of the "type of sale" column by "foreclosure." There were thirty three foreclosed homes on Zillow that night (around 11 pm). Then, I sorted the "zip code" column from A->Z. A pattern (at lease for that night's foreclosures) was automatically apparent: most of the foreclosed homes were either in the 48204 or 48227 area codes as illustrated by the scatter plot before:

The other zip codes in Detroit didn't have foreclosed homes listed that night.

I wanted to find out more about these two zip codes where most of the foreclosed houses seemed to be coming from. First I created a map of zip code boundaries using the City of Detroit Zip Code Boundaries data from the City of Detroit Open Data:

Then, I overlayed this data with Detroit Neighborhood data from the City of Detroit Open Data:

Zip code boundaries are outlined in the solid black line. From a scan of the map, I noticed
